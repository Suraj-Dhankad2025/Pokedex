A web application to explore Pokemon, built using Next.js, ShadCN, and PokeAPI. The app includes features like pagination, the ability to add PokÃ©mon to a favorites list stored in local storage, and filtering capabilities.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
	â€¢ Node.js (v16 or later) <br>
	â€¢ npm or yarn <br>
 
First, clone the Repository and open it locally 
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suraj-Dhankad2025/Pokedex.git
cd Pokedex
```
Install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## ðŸš€ Features
1.Dynamic Pagination: Efficiently loads and displays PokÃ©mon data across multiple pages without overwhelming the API or client browser.<br>
2.Favorites Management: Allows users to mark and unmark PokÃ©mon as favorites, saved directly to local storage for persistence across sessions.<br>
3.Filtering: Users can filter Pokemon based on their favorite status or Type of Pokemon.<br>

## Challenges and Solutions
1. Pagination Handling: <br>
	â€¢ Challenge: Managing dynamic data loading without degrading performance or user experience.<br>
	â€¢ Solution: Implemented server-side data fetching with getServerSideProps in Next.js to load paginated data efficiently and maintain scalability.<br>
2. Local Storage Favorites:<br>
	â€¢ Challenge: Managing favorites in local storage while maintaining Reactâ€™s state synchronization.<br>
	â€¢ Solution: Utilized the useState and useEffect hooks to synchronize local storage with React state.<br>
3. Filtering with Pagination:<br>
	â€¢ Challenge: Ensuring the filtering feature didnâ€™t conflict with the pagination system.<br>
	â€¢ Solution:<br>
	      Applied client-side filtering on the already fetched paginated data using React state.<br>
	      Maintained a seamless user experience by re-rendering the filtered list dynamically.<br>
   
## Future Enhancements
  Add advanced filtering options (e.g., by type, ability, or region).<br>
  Implement a search bar for quick Pokemon lookup.<br>
  Adding Authentication(OAuth or JWT Auth).<br>
  Enable dark mode for better accessibility.<br>
